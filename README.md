# Amazon Web Services for Data Mining
The Lambda and Step functions implemented on AWS can be found in the [aws_delivarble folder](https://github.com/LuZhang0128/thesis_2023/tree/main/aws_deliverable). 

The [data_split.py](https://github.com/LuZhang0128/thesis_2023/blob/main/aws_deliverable/data_split.py) in this folder is a data pre-processor to handle the lambda function's 15-minute limitation.
